#Procedure to run the model

There are 2 independent way to run the code, first one takes time to run the files from scratch and second way (recommended) have the saved objects and models to run it instantly

Method-1 Run from scratch takes a lot of time

1. Open your google drive and create the following directories -"IR Assignment/Dataset/News_Category_Dataset_v2.json" and upload the dataset present in the "Dataset" folder in current directory
2. Open Google Colab with the same google account and upload the following ipynb file -"Assignment_1_IR_Search_News.ipynb" present in the current directory
3. Upload the 2 folders "templates" and "static" as it is over Google Colab
4. Run all the cells, it will automatically ask for authentication while mounting your drive
5. At the end where Flask Application is present, a website to the search engine will be made available with URL - XXXXXXXX.ngrok.io

Method-2 Run saved objects and models takes fews secs (RECOMMENDED)

1. Open your google drive and create the following directories -"IR Assignment/Dataset/saved objects" and upload the files present in "saved objects" folder present in the current directory in the drive
2. Open Google Colab with the same google account and upload the following ipynb file -"Pretrained_Assignment_1_IR_Search_News.ipynb" present in the current directory
3. Upload the 2 folders "templates" and "static" as it is over Google Colab
4. Run all the cells, it will automatically ask for authentication while mounting your drive
5. At the end where Flask Application is present, a website to the search engine will be made available with URL - XXXXXXXX.ngrok.io
